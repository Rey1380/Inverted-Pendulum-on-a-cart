# Inverted-Pendulum-on-a-cart
The design requirements for the inverted pendulum state space example are:</br>
• Settling time for x and 𝜃 of less than 5 seconds</br>
• Rise time for x of less than 0.5 seconds</br>
• Pendulum angle 𝜃 never more than 20 degrees ( 0.35 radians) from the vertical</br>
• Steady state error of less than 2 % for x and 𝜃</br>
In this project We tried to design a controller for our system that can meet these requirements by using MATLAB program.
